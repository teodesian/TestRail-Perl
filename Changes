Revision history for Perl module TestRail::API

0.028 2015-06-15 TEODESIAN

    - If the only oddities in a test are passing TODO tests, mark entire run as TODO PASS.
    - Fix issue where having a ~/.testrailrc would prevent make test from allowing install by cpan client
    - Fix issue where specifying sections past the first defined in a project would fail to restrict spawning to said sections
    - Add Plan Summarizer function
    - Always append the full raw TAP to all results
    - Add closePlan and closeRun functions to TestRail::API
    - Add option to binaries, plugin to close plan/run if no untested/retest exist at end of TAP parse
